Information about the project AfterWork and its different parts.

There is a servlet and a database run by a java-program. Then there is an
application built in Android and written in java. The application can make use
of the servlet to gather information about different After Works in the database
matching the user's preferences and can present information about them.


You need to start the servlet before the android application can be of use.
How to start the servlet:

Stand in the folder Server.

There you should see at least the folders and files:
webroot
AfterWork.db
winstone.jar
compileAndRunServlet.sh
READMEServlet.txt

Compile and run the servlet by using the script compileAndRunServlet (for windows).
./compileAndRunServlet.sh

Now you are ready to start using the android application AfterWork.


Have a fun evening out!
