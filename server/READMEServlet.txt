README Servlet

Information about the servlet and java program needed for the AfterWork project.

You need to start the servlet before the android application can be of use.



How to start the servlet:

Stand in the folder Server.

There you should see at least the folders and files:
webroot
compileAndRunServlet.sh
winstone.jar
AfterWork.db
READMEServlet.txt

Compile and run the servlet by using the script compileAndRunServlet.sh (for windows).
./compileAndRunServlet.sh

Now you are ready to start the android application AfterWork and start using it!



Have fun!
