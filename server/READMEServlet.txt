README Servlet

Information about the servlet and java program needed for the AfterWork project.
To get more information about the code you can find javadoc in the folder doc.

There is a servlet and a database that are run by a java-program. The program
will take parameters along with the http request and retrieve matching After
Work's from the database. It will return the information in form of a json-file.


You need to start the servlet before you can send requests to it.
How to start the servlet:

Stand in the folder Server.

There you should see at least the folders and files:
webroot
doc
AfterWork.db
compileAndRunServlet.sh
READMEServlet.txt
winstone.jar

Compile and run the servlet by using the script compileAndRunServlet.sh.
./compileAndRunServlet.sh (for windows)

Now you are ready to start withdrawing information about different After Work's
that match your preferences from the servlet!


Have a fun evening out!
